Artaxerxes does not blame himself, bat sends him
written directions [to leave] this great war [and] pro·
oeed to an inconsiderable affair. How few there are
[Pr. Intr. 477] who if any mischanee happens, blame
themselves! Datames drew upon himself the enmity
os the courtiers the more, because the king had ordered
that he should share the command [ohap. 3, end] with
Pharnabazus. You will be in great danger, it any thing
goes wrong in Egypt, while you have the command.
There is no doubt that you will have sor your bitterest
enemy the man, whose advice the king principally sol-
lows. Written orders were seut him by the king, to
march into Cilicia with not very numerous forces.
Nothing shall hinder me from preparing the Egyptians
