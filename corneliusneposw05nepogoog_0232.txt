Cimon, the eon of Miltiades, was married to his own
sister, Elpinice by name. He says that he will not suf·
fcr the name of the tyrant to be protected by his [i. e.
the speaker'e] popularity. His duties as ambassador are
so faithfully executed by Dion, that the tyrant’s most
cruel name is protected by his popularity. It cannot be
denied thot Dionysius is much influenced by the advice
of Dion. How few are there (Pr. intr. 47⁷), who un·
dertake the post of ambassador with active-readiness,
end execute its duties with fidelity. Though Dionysius
was much influenced by Dion’s advice, yet in this mat
ter, his own private feeling was stronger.
