'l'na English edition of this little work was accom·
panied by the following brief announcement:

“ Should the plan and execution of thia little volume
meet with the approbation of able insmrctors, it will
probably be followed hya similar one on selected por-
tions of Xenophon's worhs.

“For the answers to the questions l am principally

indebted to the excellent editions of Comelius Nepos
by Bromi, thne, and Jaumano.

ln this American edition the alterations will be found
to consiat principally in a more full and correct citation
· ol illustrative passages, in frequent references to the
recent reprint of Zumpt's Latin Grammar, to confirm
or ailently modisy the positions taken, and in the addi-
tion of the notes at the foot os the page, which are re·
ferred to by letters of the alphabet.

Many other changes have been made in thecorrec· ’
tion of errors, which appear to have been the conse-
quence of haste, of which it is hoped this edition will
be comparatively free. υ

With these brief statements of what the editor is
responsible for, he leaves this little volume to win for
itself, both with teachers and pupils, the favor which
it deserves.
