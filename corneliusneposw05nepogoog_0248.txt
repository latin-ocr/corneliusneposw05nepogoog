Itis certain that Chabrias has fought a battle before
Thebes. It cannot be denied that Chabrias has marched
to ths assistance ol tho Boeotians. The rest ol the
main-body would not retire. A statue was erected to
Chabrias, lor having taught his men to kncel down
behind their shields and await the charge os the enemy
with a line os pointed spears. Chabrias wished that
nis statue should be represented in the [knecling] pos-
tire, which, by his directions, his men had assumed, ·
and which had gained them the victory. Iwill not
withdraw till Ι conquer the whole island.
