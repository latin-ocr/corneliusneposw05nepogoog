Iphicrates was so great e general, that he never lost
a battle by any sault ol his own. Is any general ol
earlier times to be preferred to Iphicrates? Iphicrates
is said never to have lost a battle by his own fault.
Iphicrates enriched the art ol wer by many new inven-
tione and many improvements. Though we diminish
the weight [of their ermor]‚ their persons will be equally

well defended, and the soldiers themselves will be able
to move end charge with greater actIvity.
